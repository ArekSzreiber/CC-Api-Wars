x    Create a web-server. This should render an HTML file containing a table with all the Planets in the Star Wars universe with these data:
x        name
x        diameter (in km)
x        climate
x        terrain
x        surface water (in percentage)
x        population in formatted way
x    Make a button in each row (in a new column) if the planet has residents. These buttons should open a modal, populated its data with AJAX,
x    containing the list of residents with more detailed information:
x        name
x        height (in meters)
x        mass (in kg)
x        skin color
x        hair color
x        eye color
x        birth year
        gender (an icon representation)
    Create a simple user login system with the following parts (use session for that):
        a registration page accessible from the main page through which visitors can create a user-password pair in the database (you are advised to use salted password hashing),
        a login page accessible from the main page where the user can log in,
        display username and logout link in the header.

Optional tasks

    If the user is logged in, display a button in each row (in a new column) with which the logged in user can vote on a planet (they can vote to unlimited number of planets). Save this vote in a database with AJAX and inform a user somehow about the vote has been saved.
    Create a new modal window accessible from the main page where you display the statistics about voted planets. Display a table with each voted planet and the number of vote the planet received. Use data from the database, receiving it with AJAX in JSON format.
